# GameSpot

Running a video game rental business made easy.

## What is GameSpot

GameSpot is a service that allows easy management for games as well as customers and rentals. It lets users add games and customer information to the database for future rental opportunities by submitting a form and eventually processing the return while setting the date out, date returned, and the rental fee.

### Motivation

My biggest motivation behind every project that I have build is my love for coding and solving problems; but this one is special. I have played and loved everything about video games from a very young age, which sparked my love for coding in the first place. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like every gamer out there at some point in their life dreamed about owning a video game store, and that's where this idea was born. I asked myself how can I most efficiently run a video game store or rental service if I were to do it now, and the answer resulted in this project.
